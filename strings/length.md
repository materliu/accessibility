# Length

It's easy in Javascript to know how many characters are in string using the property `.length`.

```js
// Just use the property .length
var size = 'Our lovely string'.length;

```

**Note:** Strings can not be substracted, multiplied or divided.

Store in the variable named `size` the length of `str`.

```js
var str = "Hello World";

var size =
```

```js
var str = "Hello World";

var size = str.length;
```

```js
assert(size === str.length);
```
