# Condition If

The easiest condition is an if statement and its syntax is `if(condition){ do this â€¦ }`. The condition has to be true for the code inside the curly braces to be executed. You can for example test a string and set the value of another string dependent on its value:

```javascript
var country = 'France';
var weather;
var food;
var currency;

if(country === 'England') {
    weather = 'horrible';
    food = 'filling';
    currency = 'pound sterling';
}

if(country === 'France') {
    weather = 'nice';
    food = 'stunning, but hardly ever vegetarian';
    currency = 'funny, small and colourful';
}

if(country === 'Germany') {
    weather = 'average';
    food = 'wurst thing ever';
    currency = 'funny, small and colourful';
}

var message = 'this is ' + country + ', the weather is ' +
            weather + ', the food is ' + food + ' and the ' +
            'currency is ' + currency;
```

**Note:** Conditions can also be nested.

Fill up the value of `name` to validate the condition.

```js
var name =

if (name === "John") {

}
```

```js
var name = "John";

if (name === "John") {

}
```

```js
assert(name === "John");
```
